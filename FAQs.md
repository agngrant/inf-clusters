##  Where should I put my data so that it can be accessed by worker nodes?
## Is there an equivalent of the usual "module" command to load (eg) python, or should I do absolutely everything off the cluster and only load the docker.
## How should I sync my data ? Can I just rsync ?
## Is there a time limit ?
## How do I check what resources are available ?
## Some linux commands that I use are missing ? For ex: unzip. Can I request these to be installed ?
## Please point me to a minimal example to get started.
