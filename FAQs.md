1.  Where should I put my data so that it can be accessed by worker nodes?
2.  Is there an equivalent of the usual "module" command to load (eg) python, or should I do absolutely everything off the cluster and only load the docker.
3.  How should I sync my data ? Can I just rsync ?
4.  Is there a time limit ?
5.  How do I check what resources are available ?
6.  Some linux commands that I use are missing ? For ex: unzip. Can I request these to be installed ?
